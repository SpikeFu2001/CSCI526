Note: 

For the shader tutorial, the rendered game view looks very different form game view.
I don't know what is causing this to happen. But to illustrate the final result of 
my still life composition I have recorded a gif.

I failed the post processing quiz so I don't have the mission complete badge.
But I have completed the tutorial.
